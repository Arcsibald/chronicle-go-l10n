# Chronicle Bot - Localization Submodule

This is the localization submodule for [Chronicle Bot](https://chroniclebot.com), a Discord event bot which pulls calendar events from external calendars such as Google Calendar.

## Supported Locales

At the moment the following locales are supported:

- American English
- German
- Spanish
- French

There locale files can be found under [/translations/locales](https://github.com/Route-8/chronicle-go-l10n/tree/main/translations/locales)

### Adding a New Locale

If you would like to contribute the translations for a new locale that would be greatly appreciated. The best way to do this it to copy one of the already completed `messages.gotext.json` files and edit it to the new language by replacing the `translation` fields.

A good example to start with would be the [German translation file](https://github.com/Route-8/chronicle-go-l10n/blob/main/translations/locales/de/messages.gotext.json).
